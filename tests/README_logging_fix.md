# Validation Test for Issue #293 Fix

This directory contains a validation test for the spdlog logging fix implemented for Issue #293.

## Issue Summary

**Problem**: spdlog logs from C++ were not always appearing in Python logging. Specifically, when creating `Database` instances, log messages would not appear until another pairinteraction function was called.

**Root Cause**: The `LoggerBridge` uses an async spdlog logger that buffers messages. However, the main issue was that `_flush_pending_logs()` was not being called after `_backend.Database.__init__()` because the decorator system excluded methods starting with "__".

## Fix Applied

**Primary Fix**: Modified `decorate_module_with_flush_logs()` in `custom_logging.py` to also decorate `__init__` methods specifically:

```python
# Before: Only decorated methods that don't start with "__"
if callable(attr) and not attr_name.startswith("__"):

# After: Include __init__ methods specifically  
if callable(attr) and (not attr_name.startswith("__") or attr_name == "__init__"):
```

This ensures that when `_backend.Database.__init__` is called, `_flush_pending_logs()` automatically runs after completion, immediately forwarding any buffered C++ log messages to Python logging.

**Secondary Fix**: Fixed logger member variable assignment in LoggerBridge constructor (was using local variable instead of member variable).

## Test Files

- `test_logging_fix_validation.py`: Integration test that reproduces the issue scenario and validates the fix

## Running the Test

```bash
# From the repository root
python tests/test_logging_fix_validation.py
```

The test will:
1. Set up Python logging as described in the issue
2. Create Database instances that should log messages
3. Verify that log messages appear immediately without requiring additional function calls
4. Report success or failure of the fix

## Expected Results

- **Before fix**: Database logs would only appear after calling another pairinteraction function
- **After fix**: Database logs appear immediately after Database constructor completes due to automatic log flushing via the decorator
