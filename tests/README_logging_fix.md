# Validation Test for Issue #293 Fix

This directory contains a validation test for the spdlog logging fix implemented for Issue #293.

## Issue Summary

**Problem**: spdlog logs from C++ were not always appearing in Python logging. Specifically, when creating `Database` instances, log messages would not appear until another pairinteraction function was called.

**Root Cause**: The `LoggerBridge` uses an async spdlog logger that buffers messages. The messages remained in the async buffer and weren't immediately sent to the `QueueSink` that forwards them to Python.

## Fix Applied

1. **Added flush call**: In `LoggerBridge::get_pending_logs()`, added `logger->flush()` to ensure buffered async messages are processed before retrieving them from the queue.

2. **Fixed logger assignment**: Corrected the logger member variable assignment in the constructor.

## Test Files

- `test_logging_fix_validation.py`: Integration test that reproduces the issue scenario and validates the fix

## Running the Test

```bash
# From the repository root
python tests/test_logging_fix_validation.py
```

The test will:
1. Set up Python logging as described in the issue
2. Create Database instances that should log messages
3. Verify that log messages appear immediately without requiring additional function calls
4. Report success or failure of the fix

## Expected Results

- **Before fix**: Database logs would only appear after calling another pairinteraction function
- **After fix**: Database logs appear immediately when the logging system is flushed
