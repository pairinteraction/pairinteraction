The pairinteraction software comes with a graphical user interface (GUI) and a Python API. The GUI provides a quick way
to calculate Rydberg interaction potentials, lifetimes, and energy shifts in the presence of external fields. The Python
API is designed to automatize calculations and to have more fine-grained control.

**Introduction**

The following jupyter notebooks introduce the Python API. The other tutorials build on this introduction.

**Examples Demonstrating Basic Usage**

We show exemplary applications of the Python API, ranging from the calculation of single-atom properties such as
lifetimes to calculations of pair potentials.

Tutorials - Graphical User Interface
------------------------------------

The graphical user interface (GUI) of pairinteraction can be started by executing

.. code-block:: bash

    pairinteraction gui

from the command line. Below we show a few examples of how one can use the GUI.
