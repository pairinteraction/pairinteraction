The pairinteraction software comes with a graphical user interface (GUI) and a Python API.
The GUI provides a quick way to calculate Rydberg interaction potentials and energy shifts in the presence of external fields.
The Python API is designed to automatize calculations and to have more fine-grained control.

Graphical User Interface
------------------------

.. rubric:: Introduction

Here we introduce how the GUI of pairinteraction can be used to calculate interactions between Rydberg atoms and energy shifts in the presence of applied fields.
