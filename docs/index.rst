  :alt: The pairinteraction software

The *pairinteraction* software calculates properties of Rydberg systems.
The software consists of a Python library and a graphical user interface for pair potential calculations, making use of a high-performance C++ backend.
For usage examples visit the :ref:`tutorials <Tutorials>`.
Stay tuned by `signing up`_ for the newsletter so whenever there are updates to the software or new publications about pairinteraction we can contact you.
If you have a question that is related to problems, bugs, or suggests an improvement, consider raising an :github:`issue <issues>` on :github:`GitHub <>`.

Binary installers are available through :github:`GitHub Releases <releases>`.
For using pairinteraction as a Python 3 library, we recommend the installation via pip by calling

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install pairinteraction

If pairinteraction was installed via pip, the graphical user
interface can be started by executing ``start_pairinteraction_gui`` from the command line.
