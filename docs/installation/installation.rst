Installation
============

This guide provides installation instructions for the `pairinteraction` software, catering to users of all levels. We offer two different installation options:
    :ref:`Basic Installation <basic>` - For users who want to use the python interface or the graphical user interface

    :ref:`Advanced Installation <advanced>`  - For developers and experienced users who want to adjust the source code to their own needs, or for :ref:`contributing to the package. <repository>`

All methods install the graphical user interface of pairinteraction. It allows for calculating pair potentials taking into account electric and magnetic fields, as well as Stark and Zeeman maps. In addition, all methods except for the binary installers, provide a Python library which can be used to write your own code and have more fine-grained control over what pairinteraction does. For usage examples visit the :ref:`tutorials <Tutorials>` section of the documentation.
