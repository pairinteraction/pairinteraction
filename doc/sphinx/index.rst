The *pairinteraction* software calculates properties of Rydberg systems.
The software consists of a C++ backend, a Python library, and a graphical user interface for pair potential calculations.
For usage examples visit the :ref:`tutorials <Tutorials>` section of the documentation.
Stay tuned by `signing up`_ for the newsletter so whenever there are updates to the software or new publications about pairinteraction we can contact you.
If you have a question that is related to problems, bugs, or suggests an improvement, consider raising an :github:`issue <issues>` on :github:`GitHub <>`.

Binary builds are available through :github:`GitHub Releases <releases>`. 
For using pairinteraction as a Python 3 library, we recommend the installation via pip by calling

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install pairinteraction

If pairinteraction was installed via pip, the graphical user
interface can be started by executing ``start_pairinteraction_gui`` from the command line.
