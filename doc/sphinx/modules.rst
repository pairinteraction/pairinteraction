Modules
=======

The module ``pireal`` can be used if matrix elements are purely real-valued. If one considers electric or magnetic fields with a non-zero :math:`y`-value, the module ``picomplex`` must be used.

Note that this part of the documentation is under construction, the `tutorials`_ might be more useful.
