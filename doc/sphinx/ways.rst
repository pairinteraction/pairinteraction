Ways to Contribute
==================

The pairinteraction software has greatly benefited from the contributions of our community. If you're also interested in enhancing pairinteraction, this guide is for you. Don't hesitate to reach out to the maintainers for any questions or further assistance.

Reporting Issues
    Encountered a bug or have a suggestion? Help us improve by submitting an issue on :github:`our GitHub issue page <issues>`. Your input is invaluable for ongoing improvements and bug fixes.

Contributing New Quantum Defects
    Precise quantum defects are crucial for our software's accuracy. We particularly seek improvements for species with two-valence electrons, where data remains sparse. If you've conducted research that provides new quantum defects, sharing your data would significantly benefit the community. We highlight such contributions in our :doc:`README <index>` to ensure both the software and your research receive appropriate recognition and citation.
    
Writing Tutorials
    Share your knowledge by writing tutorials. If you've published research utilizing pairinteraction, consider contributing a tutorial. This not only aids others in replicating your results but also enhances the visibility of your work. Your tutorial can serve as a practical guide for applying pairinteraction to solve complex problems.

Developing Features or Resolving Bugs
    Community contributions in the form of new features or bug fixes are immensely appreciated. They not only alleviate the workload on our maintainers but also enrich the software with diverse expertise. Your contributions can make a significant difference, especially in areas outside our maintainers' specialties.
